The [Data Stores](https://app.sentra.io/stores) page provides a metadata catalog of your data in the store level - buckets, databases, etc.

You can view, filter, sort and group stores by different properties - general, classification, security, network & access. The information can be viewed in a tabular format (in the app or exported as CSV), grouped in a heatmap or expanded with a detailed view by clicking on each data store.

## Supported Services
Sentra provides automatic discovery and classification of data in various data sources, across main cloud providers and their services. Discovery includes full cataloging of existing data stores along with their metadata and security properties, while classification includes the detection of schema in tabular assets like DB tables and tabular objects (i.e. `json`, `parquet`, etc.)
The following list describes the currently supported services in each platform.
