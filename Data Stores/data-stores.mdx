## GUI Overview

The Data Stores page is a versatile tool that empowers users to manage and analyze their data stores effectively. It offers a comprehensive range of functionalities, including the ability to seamlessly **view**, **filter**, **sort**, and **group** data stores based on various properties. These properties include general information, classification attributes, security considerations, and network access parameters.

The Data Stores page provides users with a structured tabular representation of the information, easily accessible within the application interface. This presentation format allows for convenient viewing and analysis of the data assets. Additionally, users can export the displayed information grid into a downloadable **Comma-Separated Values (CSV)** file. This feature enables users to analyze further and process the data using external tools and systems.

Moreover, users can explore each data asset in greater detail by simply clicking on it. This action triggers a transition to a more comprehensive and expanded view, giving users a deeper understanding of the specific attributes and characteristics of the selected data asset. This enhanced level of detail facilitates thorough examination and informed decision-making for the respective data asset.

### Detailed View

Once any data store is clicked, the detailed view provides an expanded perspective and presents information across multiple categories, including:

## Data Stores Attributes

Below are the comprehensive details of the attributes associated with data stores.

### Sensitivity

Each data store is classified based on the sensitivity score calculated internally by Sentra. The calculation process involves analyzing the data classes present in the objects and assessing their sensitivity levels. The sensitivity levels are assigned based on predefined criteria that determine the degree of sensitivity associated with each data class.

<img src={sensitivityLevels} alt="Data Asset Sensitivity"/>

In sensitivity classification, the terms **none**, **low**, **medium**, and **high** describe the different sensitivity levels associated with data store. Here is a more explanation a detailed breakdown of what each category means:

**None:** Indicates that the data contains no sensitive information. It refers to data that is non-confidential, publicly available or does not pose any significant risks if accessed or disclosed.

**Low:** This level is assigned to data that contains relatively low-risk or moderately sensitive information. It implies that the data may have some level of confidentiality or privacy considerations, but the potential impact of its unauthorized access or disclosure is relatively minimal.

**Medium:** The "Medium" sensitivity level indicates that the data contains moderately sensitive information that requires a higher level of protection. It implies that unauthorized access or disclosure of this data could result in moderate risks, such as privacy breaches, financial loss, or regulatory non-compliance.

**High:** A high sensitivity level is assigned to highly confidential, sensitive, or sensitive data. This position means that unauthorized access or disclosure of this data could result in serious harm, such as significant economic loss, legal liability, defamation, breach of privacy, or strong security measures, including the most robust access controls, encryption, monitoring, and auditing are required

Organizations can effectively determine the appropriate security measures and controls to implement by categorizing data into these sensitivity levels. It allows for a more targeted approach in safeguarding sensitive information, mitigating risks, and ensuring compliance with data protection regulations and policies.

### Context Labels

Context Labels are generated using metadata and contextual information associated with the data stores. These labels serve as descriptive markers that provide additional insights into the assets based on factors such as the data store's file path, location, and neighboring assets. Context Labels offer valuable contextual information without the need to scan the actual content of the data store.

The available options for Context Labels encompass a range of values that help categorize and classify the assets. These options include:

**Configuration:** This label indicates that the asset pertains to configuration-related information.

**Log:** This label is assigned to assets that contain log data or log files.

**Image:** Assets labeled with this indicate that they are image files or contain image data.

**Tabular:** This label signifies that the asset contains tabular data or is structured in a table format.

**Compression:** Assets labeled with this represent compressed files or data.

**Source Code:** This label is assigned to assets that contain source code or programming scripts.

**Documents:** Assets labeled as "Documents" typically refer to files containing textual or document-based content.

**Binary:** This label is used for assets that consist of binary data or binary file formats.

**Font:** Assets labeled "Font" are related to font files or data.

**Cryptography:** This label indicates assets associated with cryptography or cryptographic operations.

**Media:** Assets labeled as "Media" typically refer to files containing multimedia content, such as audio, video, or multimedia presentations.

> **Note:** Assets here refers to AWS-based components relevant to the above options.

The Context Label feature enhances asset description by assigning additional tags based on the available metadata and contextual information. These tags provide further details about the asset, including its file path, location within the system, and other relevant characteristics. Data Context tags are derived from readily available information without content scanning or analysis. They serve as supplementary descriptors that assist in understanding and organizing the assets based on their contextual attributes.

## Available Filters

To provide users with enhanced control over their data stores, two primary filters are available for their utilization. These filters serve as valuable tools in refining and organizing data according to specific criteria. Let's delve into the details of each filter category and its associated sub-filters.

<img src={filterOption} alt="Available Filters"/>

#### Data Stores Filter Category

Under the Data Store filter category, users can access various sub-filters to facilitate their search and management of the data store. These sub-filters include:

**General:** This subset encompasses non-information fields such as size, account, type, last modified, and the associated data store. Users can refine their search based on these fundamental attributes by utilizing these available filters.

**Classification:** This set of filters is designed to categorize data stores into different classes. It includes fields such as Data Categories (Unclassified, Credentials, Financial & Personal), Data Class, and Sensitivity (None, Low, Medium, High). Users can leverage these filters to classify and sort their data stores effectively.

**Security:** This filter enables users to group data stores based on their security characteristics, such as private or public access. By utilizing this filter, users can conveniently filter and manage their data stores based on their security requirements.

**Network & Access:** This filter allows users to categorize data stores based on their network attributes and characteristics, including VPC ID, Security Group ID, Subnet Group, and Subnet IDs. By leveraging this filter, users can quickly sort and administer their data stores according to their network properties.

> **Note:** It is important to note that each filter within these categories will display a comprehensive list of available values within the grid, allowing users to select and apply their desired filter criteria easily.
