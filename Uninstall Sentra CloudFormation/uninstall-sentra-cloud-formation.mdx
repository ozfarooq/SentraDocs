Once configured within the Sentra Account, the Sentra account association with different cloud platforms can also be uninstalled from the Cloud portal. Users can redirect to [Sentra Accounts](https://app.sentra.io/accounts)

Sentra currently supports Azure, AWS & Snowflake cloud platforms that can be integrated with internal entities like Data Assets and Data Stores once configured. Sentra accounts can be disassociated directly from the cloud platform for unused or inactive configured accounts. Here is how Sentra's account can be removed from AWS instantly.

## Uninstalling Sentra Account

To uninstall Sentra and remove the associated resources using AWS CloudFormation, two steps are to be followed:

1. Removing Scanner Account from AWS account

2. Removing Target Account from AWS account

### Uninstalling Scanner Account

Log in to the AWS account where you deployed the "Scanner Account" using Sentra. Users must follow the prerequisites below to avoid any later configurational issues.

#### Prerequisites

Ensure that Sentra's buckets are empty, precisely the results and inputs buckets. To do this:

1. Go to the AWS S3 console.

2. Locate **Sentra's results and inputs buckets** in the search and retrieve all relevant buckets as shown in the screenshot below.

3. Click on each bucket individually and select the **`Empty`** option to remove all objects from the buckets.

#### Uninstalling Sentra StackSet

The next step is to delete the Sentra associated StackSets. The below steps depict the exact flow for the users.

1. Navigate to the CloudFormation console and select **StackSets**.

10. Proceed to the CloudFormation console and select **Stacks**.

11. Locate Sentra's Stack and click on its name.

12. Click on **Delete** and confirm the deletion by selecting **Delete stack**.

#### Uninstalling Target Account

Once StackSet is deleted, the next step is to completely uninstall Sentra from the Target Account, which the following steps can perform:

1. Access the "CloudFormation" service in the AWS Management Console.

2. Navigate to the "Stacks" section.

4. Within the Stack details, click "Delete" and confirm the deletion process by selecting "Delete stack."

Once Stack is deleted, all associated Sentra and the relevant AWS accounts are disconnected and cannot be used until it is configured again.
